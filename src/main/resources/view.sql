There is no way back.

Ignoring the cold, I open the glass hatch until it stops. I reach out my hand and gently remove the clinging curl from the girl''s face. Her eyelashes, dusted with frost, tremble slightly, and the former prisoner of the cold takes a deep breath.

I wonder what she feels at this moment? I don''t think that her awakening is accompanied by the same hopelessness that visits me every morning. I''ll ask her when the remnants of sleep leave her body, but in the meantime I''ll wait and hope that I''m doing everything right.

I didn''t know what to do when interrupting cryo-sleep. Leave a person in a cell and wait for full heating? Or take him out and put him to bed? Belatedly, a terrible thought comes that it was worth waking up the rest of the people first, and not ruining such beauty with your inexperience.

Unearthly beauty.

Thick blonde hair frames a face with perfect skin, eyelashes seem artificial. The fragile figure takes up half as much space as is provided in the cryo-chamber chair. She looks like Aphrodite from the illustrations of the book that I hid and did not let her burn in the oven.

Aphrodite from another world.

From the old world.

From the old Earth.

I want to sit down on the floor, take out a notebook and write poetry. And also draw. I would paint her portrait, enclose in paper the cold with which she is surrounded. But I don''t know how to paint portraits — just lousy poems in a new world that needs beautiful poetry to kindle stoves.

The girl opens her eyes. They are gray-blue, faded, but the look fills them with brightness. An inquisitive and slightly suspicious look. She looks at me, and then quietly asks:

— What year is it now?

Although I am tempted to answer that this world no longer needs a calendar, I still remember four digits:

- Two. Two. Eight. Eight.

- It''s early.

- Early-what?

"It''s early," she repeats, and tears begin to roll down her cheeks, warming her cold skin. Unearthly beauty.

"Ward, Jacoby! Then you will add, we have an emergency. Two groups have left for the city – the orcs there have done something again-so today you are going on patrol.

— But we have an annual report on the nose and…

"I''ll give you two more days to write and three days off after that," Ward''s eyes slowly crawled to his forehead from the words of his superiors. — Well, quickly get your asses up and go, before I''m kind and have time to change my mind. Go-go-go!

Their life could not be the same again, and he was clearly aware of this — even if this thought scared him. And although along with the fear there was another feeling, the name of which was curiosity, Tadashi still continued to catch himself thinking "there is no way back anymore", thoughtfully staring at a random point after every physical contact with Hiro, after every shy look or short kiss. As the days passed, the younger brother''s gazes became more and more thoughtful and long. Tadashi saw in his black iris the same questions and doubts, the same spark of fleeting desire and curiosity that was inside himself. He saw it and patiently pressed his lips together, thinking over and over again the events of the past months.
Tadashi intuitively understood that Hiro was waiting for something. When he hugged him before going to bed, hugging him to himself, he felt every deep breath and tension that passed through his body. After that, Hiro habitually relaxed in his arms and fell asleep. Tadashi felt that the deep waters they were sinking into were getting darker every day. And it was only a matter of time when they would reach the depth that he had been afraid of for so long.
It was about midnight when Tadashi noticed again how Hiro''s whole body tensed when he put his arm around his waist, as usual. Tadashi got up to turn off the lamp over the bed, and silently settled behind his brother-as usual, pressing his front against his back. He waited for Hiro to relax again, but it never happened.
"Hiro," Tadashi said softly. — Is something wrong?
Hiro was silent, and Tadashi felt uncomfortable in the utter silence of the night room. From everywhere, out of the unknown black darkness, hundreds of strange eyes seemed to be watching him, judging and clinging to every action or thought. It was as if he needed to control even the way he breathed. The truth was that on an intuitive level, he had long guessed what was going on, just to face it face to face was something unreal. Even when they crossed the very first boundaries of what was allowed, he still believed that it was still a very long way to those deep, terrible waters. So far away that they will never reach them',

VALUES ( '1', 'Harry Potter" by J. Rowling', 'I slowly crossed a small clearing, heading for a stream that flowed not far from the house. My mother did not let me go any further, which undoubtedly upset me. Green summer grass was growing around, pleasantly tickling her knees, which were not hidden by a simple pink dress, the sleeve of which was not very neatly sewn, and there were several patches on the hem.

With my hands, I tightly clutched a small purse to my chest, wildly afraid of dropping it. Thank Merlin that no one was observed nearby. The last thing I wanted right now was to communicate with anyone. That is why I got up with the first roosters, greatly surprising my parents with this, had a hasty but hearty breakfast and, taking with me some book, of which there were a great many in the house, left the house, trying not to cross paths with my brothers, especially with Fred and George. The brothers, of course, did not want to harm their only sister, but this did not prevent them from joking with me, moreover, very cruelly. Mother swore at the twins very loudly and for a long time, but it didn''t help much.

I sighed sadly and leaned over the cool water to look at my reflection. The fiery hair was gathered, hair to hair, in a thick braid. On a round, pale face, freckles stood out in bright spots, which made me feel shy. But most of all, I liked my eyes in my appearance. Bright, amber, like molten gold. I could even call myself pretty if it weren''t for the damn freckles.

"What a pity that my mother does not allow them to be brought together," I thought dejectedly. My eyes stung sharply, and my breath was lost. Hugging myself, I slowly sank to the ground and muttered: "My name is Ginevra Molly Weasley. I''m eleven years old. I have a large and friendly family. I''m going to Hogwarts this year. A week ago, I had a strong magical release. And I almost don''t remember what happened before that..."

Thoughts that were trying to spread out in different directions, like beetles, began to gradually weave together. This way to take myself in hand was suggested to me by the healer Wester. A week ago, when I came to myself in St. Mungo''s Hospital, I almost died of horror. Strangers were scurrying around, and a strange red-haired woman was sobbing, trying to hug me. Fortunately, the healers quickly expelled all outsiders from the ward, and by the evening I remembered my family. Well, at least she remembered names and faces. I never remembered my emotions towards my relatives. I had to literally get acquainted again.

I only found out what happened at home. I was at a bookstore with my family and Harry Potter, buying textbooks for school. And my mother was desperate to get an autograph from a certain Gilderoy Lockhart. After that, Daddy, according to Percy, got into a skirmish with a certain Mr. Malfoy. Judging by his brother''s reverent tone, this Malfoy is a very influential person.

It is not known how the conflict would have ended if it had not been for the twins. No one, except these same twins, does not know what exactly they blew up, but it rumbled significantly. The brawlers suffered first of all, but I also got hurt, as I was standing closest to the brawlers. And, as my relatives told me, when I realized that I had lost my fiery hair, there was a powerful magical release. Thank Merlin that this happened already on the street, without harming the shops. Otherwise, the already poor parents could go bankrupt by paying compensation. ',

Morax ran his hand along the thick trunk of the tree and sighed heavily. It, like everything around, was alive and saturated with memories, and the realization of this made it even harder for the man to be here.

- Listen, what do you need now? - not that with anger, but with some suspicion and readiness for what this restless and passionate guy can throw out this time, Dilyuk asks, calmly rubbing the glass.

Probably, not every passerby could have noticed that Captain Alberich was drunk: his eyes were not blurred, and his gaze remained clear, mysterious and brilliant. His speech remained coherent and even made sense and no matter what. Perhaps, in a drunken state, he just wanted to philosophize more, but he copes well without it. Dilyuk has repeatedly reasoned and tried to understand why Keya drinks, if nothing really changes? It remains the same, except that it spoils the liver. Or would he still not understand?

- Hmph... "Pyro essence"? What do you mean by that? - Dilyuk was not stupid or naive, he understood what Keya was driving at, because this is not the first time he hears this from him. But he was definitely interested in what this schemer would say this time. For example, one day he said that he wanted to change clothes, because Dilyuk''s gloves look warm, and his black coat is so cozy, like a dressing gown. And now I decided to give up with the eye of God. Is he cold? From the inside? Is the cryo eye of god to blame for this? Is that why Keia is looking for different ways to keep warm? And what if he uses alcohol for this, to keep warm somewhere inside? Such questions occupied Ragnvindr''s mind. You didn''t think he was really that cold to Keya, did you? As if he doesn''t care about him? And it''s not like that.

- I want to be... like that piece of ice on the archipelago... what you melted.

Tony doesn''t think so himself. Because all this life he feels lonely. Because he has no one but Roadie. Because Pepper is leaving, taking Happy with him, and Rhodes is in Washington. Because when the story of the contract begins, he feels so acutely his loneliness among the Avengers. Despite the fact that Roadie is coming.

Cap resists, like a cat who does not want to wash, with all his paws. Stark tries his best to convince, to prevent, to save everything... but. By the time Barnes is dragged to the base, the situation already seems critical. But Tony is still trying. Desperately hoping that Steve, with whom they almost became friends, as it seemed to him, who became his colleague, colleague, support, this Steve will understand. Support him, sign the damn contract. But they quarrel, because of Wanda, although most of all in this situation, Stark wants to protect and preserve everything that he has left. The Avengers, including Wanda. He wants to keep it at any cost.

Therefore, when Steve bends down to put down the pen after an argument, Tony can''t stand it.

"Steve, wait -" he holds him by the wrist.

"I think we''ve already figured it out, Tony," Cap irritably shrugs off his hand.

"Maybe I''m not completely right..." the words come hard, but if it helps to avoid the impending threat of disintegration, Tony is ready even for that. It''s not the first time he''s lied.

— What do I hear? Do you admit that you are wrong? Rogers raises an eyebrow mockingly.

- Don''t go away. We have to deal with this. Together, - it sounds frankly pathetic and too pathetic, but…

There is a sharp pain in his chest and the last thing Tony sees before he loses consciousness is Cap''s face, surprised that he quoted it to him and worried at the same time. He wakes up in the hospital. Doctors dance for a long time over his battered heart, put ivs and stuff them with pills, not the most pleasant pastime, but once he has already got it, they will not let him out quietly.

In the evening, Steve arrives, looking frankly guilty and worried. And silently holds out the signed contract.

- Oh, you signed it. If I knew how easy it is to persuade you, I would fall at your feet every time — " he grins, exulting inside. Turn out. He could, I think he could.

"Tony, this isn''t funny. You brought yourself to a heart attack, " Cap frowns, not even smiling at the joke.

- Microinfarction. It''s not so terrible — Tony himself had already found out everything he could about his health and was absolutely not worried. I was just waiting for him to finally be released. Rogers just looks hard and sighs. And he leaves, still in silence.

Then Natasha comes and says that someone posing as a psychologist tried to activate Winter, but in the end Cap grabbed him, stopped Barnes, knocked him out, and beat out the truth about the setup in Vienna.

"It was scary to look at Steve, Stark. I thought he was going to kill this Zemo. It''s good that I woke up in time, and, as it seems to me, only to get information out. Don''t do that again, Tony, or we''ll have to clear Captain America of murder charges later.

— Like I planned this, — he grins, secretly flattered.

— You know what I mean. Take care of yourself, please.

When Tony leaves the hospital, Barnes is sent to Wakanda at the invitation of T''challa, who promised to help with the codes, such a gesture of apology for a mistake, and Steve follows Tony almost on his heels. Silently, periodically looking into his eyes and occasionally asking about his well-being.

"Rogers, stop playing the babysitter! There''s nothing wrong with me, and you''re not feeding me with a spoon! - Stark can''t stand it anymore, not to mention that it''s impossible to work when they take away your coffee and send you to bed every night.

Cap is silent on all the outrages, and Tony can''t help but admit that every day the feeling of loneliness recedes a little.

A month later, Steve tells him what Zemo wanted to do. And about how he falsified the tape with the murder of his parents, which was committed by another Hydra agent, one of those five, from a bunker in Siberia. Cap, Sam, and Natasha went there while Tony was still in the hospital. Two weeks later, Tony finally moves to the Base. He tells everyone that it''s just more convenient for him, but in fact, because he doesn''t feel lonely there. Almost feels like he has a family. And Steve. At the base, Steve, to whom Tony has already become so attached to his soul that now he is afraid of it.',
